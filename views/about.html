            <p>Dieter Rams (born 20 May 1932 in Wiesbaden, Hessen) is a German industrial designer and retired academic closely associated with the consumer products company Braun, the furniture company Vitsœ, and the functionalist school of industrial design. His unobtrusive approach and belief in <span>"Less, but better"</span> design generated a timeless quality in his products and have influenced the design of many products, which also secured Rams worldwide recognition and appreciation.</p>
            <p>Dieter Rams began his studies in architecture and interior decoration at Wiesbaden School of Art in 1947, now part of the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences. A year later, in 1948, he took a break from studying to gain practical experience and finish his carpentry apprenticeship. He returned to the Wiesbaden School of Art in 1948 and graduated in architecture with honours in 1953, after which he began working for Frankfurt-based architect Otto Apel. In 1955, he was recruited to Braun as an architect and an interior designer. In 1961, he became the chief design officer at Braun, a position he retained until 1995. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams" target="_blank" class="profile">Read more.</a></p>

            <h4>Ten principles for good design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span>1. Good design is innovative —</span> The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</li>
                <li><span>2. Good design makes a product useful —</span> A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</li>
                <li><span>3. Good design is aesthetic —</span> The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</li>
                <li><span>4. Good design makes a product understandable —</span> It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</li>
                <li><span>5. Good design is unobtrusive —</span> Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.</li>
                <li><span>6. Good design is honest —</span> It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</li>
                <li><span>7. Good design is long-lasting —</span> It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway society.</li>
                <li><span>8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail —</span> Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.</li>
                <li><span>9. Good design is environmentally-friendly —</span> Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</li>
                <li><span>10. Good design is as little design as possible —</span> Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</li>
            </ul>
